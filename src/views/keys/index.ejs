        <p class="lead">Every musical key includes a group of notes that each has a corresponding frequency expressed in Hertz, otherwise know as "cycles per second". The waveform of the note's pitch completes its cycle a certain amount of times per second. This is expressed in a decimal number, and can be used to find the related tempo ("beats per minute") that a note's pitch ideally completes its cycle in time with. Choose a key, and find the notes (and their corresponding tempos) that are aligned with it.</p>
        <p class="text-muted text-right">(Pitch reference is A=440Hz. Major scale notes only.)</p>
