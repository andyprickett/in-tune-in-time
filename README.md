# In Tune In Time

#### A charmingly simple full-stack web application that allows users to find the precise tempo for their music based on the frequency of the notes involved in it.

## Features
* Choose a musical note and get back the tempo for that note.
* Choose a musical key and get back a list of the notes in the key with their respective tempos.
* (Soon!) Enter a tempo and get back the nearest in tune, in time tempo with the associated note.
* (Soon!) Create a user account and save favorites.
* (Soon!) More in-depth explanations about the theory behind this and more importantly how to apply it.
* (Someday!) API for just the data so other apps can use it.

## Technologies
* Node backend with Express framework.
* Server-rendered pages using EJS templates.
* Sequelize ORM with PostgreSQL database.
* Tests written in Jasmine.
* Styling (or lack therof) with Bootstrap. Just enough to get things up and running, as the name indicates.

## Comments
This application satisfied a requirement for the Bloc Web Developer Track program. It has only been through one "sprint". It is operational on my local machine, and in a [live deployment on Heroku](https://andyprickett-in-tune-in-time.herokuapp.com/). I will be continuing to work on this, however, as it is something my friends and I will find useful. I hope to rewrite it using React, and of course better styling.
